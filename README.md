# A simple captcha library

This repo contains a simple captcha library that permits you to "authenticate" humans. I don't know if it is really efficient but here it is.

## Why ?

I needed to add a captcha on one of my page in a school project and found no interesting solution that was GPDR-compliant or not powered by a NSA-backdoored corporation. So I decided to implement my own when my colleagues has shown me it's actually **dead stupid** to draw an image using GD.

## How ?

You can actually find a demo of how to use it on ``demo.php``
